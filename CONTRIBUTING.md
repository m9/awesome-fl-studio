# Contribution

Thank you for contributing to **Awesome FL Studio**!

Please read the following guidelines and try to follow them to the fullest extent possible.

## Contribution guidelines

Please ensure your contribution adheres to the following guidelines:
* Please search for issues and pull requests before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate or an [exclusion](https://github.com/indiscipline/awesome-reaper/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aexclusion+).
* Follow the established structure of the list or suggest a change in an issue. New categories or categorization improvements are welcome.
* Points should follow the format: `[NAME](LINK) - DESCRIPTION`. You can add a complimentary link to the description.
* Follow alphabetical order within each category.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
* End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
Please, refrain from using qualitative descriptions such as: "best", "nice", "greatest", etc.
* Try to get permission from the authors to share the links to their resources.
* Respect privacy: Don't disclose **any** personal data, unless explicitly public (for example: a YouTube channel named with a person's legal name).

## Quality standards

The additions to the list should meet the following criteria for inclusion:
* Generally valuable for the community.
* The resource should be freely available. Paywalled media, courses, articles or strictly commercial products are not allowed.
* Free Software or Open Source are prioritized over freeware or source-available for tools, software, and scripts.
* For books, articles and resources, Copyleft and Creative Commons licensed or Public Domain materials are prioritized over copyrighted ones.
* When applicable, a project should be actively maintained and documented.
* It wasn't asked [to be excluded from the list](https://github.com/m9/awesome-fl-studio/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aexclusion+) (see [Voluntary exclusion](#voluntary-exclusion) below).

## Commit and Pull Request guidelines:

* There should be an individual [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for each change. Multiple changes within a single subcategory is OK.
* Please squash your commits before opening the pull request.
* Keep descriptions short and simple.
* Include motivation for your additions in the pull request description.

## Voluntary exclusion

Some resources wish not to be linked anywhere or, occasionally, here.

If you wish to be excluded from this list, we ask the responsible party to file an issue titled `Exclusion request: Name of the Resource` to log the request and prevent future re-additions. If you want to avoid mentioning sensitive information, contact the repo's maintainers so they can deal with the issue without disclosing your data. Please make a prudent step forward and provide the reasoning for the exclusion if possible.

## Git basics

If you're new to Git-based collaboration, GitHub features a comprehensive documentation section.
For your pull requests, follow the [quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).

### TLDR:

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch.
- Add a single meaningful change.
- Commit with a short descriptive title and description explaining the motivation for the change.
- Create a pull request from your fork to the original repository.
